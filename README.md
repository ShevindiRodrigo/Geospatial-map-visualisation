## Introduction
  Data related to geographical location on earth are defined as geospatial data.
  The absolute locations of geospatial data are defined by latitudes and longitudes. (Raihan, 2022, para 1)

  Geospatial map visualization is use of geospatial  map visualization tools or software for the analysis of geospatial data.
  Geospatial map visualization is used to develop visualization of large geospatial data.

  Geospatial data visualization is a helpful technique that incorporates interactive visualization into standard maps, enabling users to explore different map layers, zoom in and out, change the map's visual appearance, and connect a variety of factors to the geographic area.

  There are a lot of packages out there which can achieve geospatial map visualization. Namely Plotly, Folium, Spatial AI (Raihan, 2022)
  
  Plotly is one of  the valuable, open-source free data visualization Python library. (What Is Plotly? - Plotly Video Tutorial | LinkedIn Learning, Formerly Lynda.com, n.d., 2021)
  
  In addition to statistical charts and financial charts, plotly contain mapping plots to get most out of your geospatial data. (What Is Plotly? - Plotly Video Tutorial | LinkedIn Learning, Formerly Lynda.com, n.d., 2021)
  Through interactive and engaging visualizations, Plotly assists us in providing insights into geospatial data.
  
  Scatter geo, choropleth, choropleth mapbox, lines on map etc. are some of the mapping techniques used by Plotly.

## Case Study
In this study, I have focused on demonstrating global and Asian inflation rates for 2022 and then visualize them using the following techniques:
  1. Choropleth Map
  2. Geographical Scatter Plot
In addition to <s>plotly<s>, I used Python libraries such as Pandas and json to complete the task

## Data description 
The dataset contains yearly inflation rates of 2022 and 2023 of 196 countries. Dataset was extracted from International Monetary Fund website.
